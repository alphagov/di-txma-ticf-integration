# TICF Zendesk integration with TxMA

This repository allows for Zendesk integration with Transaction Monitoring and Auditing (TxMA) which is part of the Digital Identity (DI) system. Events from Zendesk will be able to trigger an automated process to begin the extraction of Audit data from S3.

Threat Intelligence and Counter Fraud (TICF) analysts will be able to request audit data that is stored in S3 via Zendesk tickets. This will trigger an automated process to copy the data to another S3 bucket where Athena queries can be run. The requester is then notified when the query has finished and their results are available via a pre-signed URL in another S3 bucket. The integration with Zendesk also means that tickets can be updated throughout the automated process.

## Pre-requisites

To run this project you will need the following:

- [SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) - Used to build and deploy the application
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Recommended way to install is via [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - Required to run SAM locally
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) - The package manager for the project

## Getting started

The project is using [Yarn Zero Installs](https://yarnpkg.com/features/zero-installs). So as long as Yarn itself is installed, everything should be ready to go out of the box. The only thing that needs to be enabled is the Husky hooks.

```
yarn husky install
```

Zero installs works because the dependencies are committed via the `.yarn` folder. These are all compressed, so the folder size is much smaller than `node_modules` would be.

In order to ensure that dependencies cannot be altered by anything other than Yarn itself, we run `yarn install --check-cache` in the pipeline. This avoids the possibility of malicous users altering any dependency code.

## Code standards

This repository is set up to use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for formatting, and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to look for problems in any Typescript and Javascript code.

Prettier is an opinionated formatting tool for multiple languages/file formats. Exceptions can be added to the `.prettierrc.json` file.

ESLint is configured to use just its recommended rules via the `.eslintrc.json` file. These can be viewed at:

- [Javscript](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/)
- [Typescript](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/main/packages/eslint-plugin/src/configs/eslint-recommended.ts)

Additionally, its code formatting rules are disabled as these are handled by Prettier.

To run the linting:

```
yarn lint
```
